# MTTT 2
Minecraft Trouble in Terrorist Town remake, fully coded by me (Do not mistake the name)

# Dependencies
All depends are integrated into the pom.xml except for CorpseReborn which you will need to compile
and add to your local repo yourself.

They are as follows:

ProtocolLib: Needed for Traitor and Detective glowing so you can identify teammates
CorpseReborn: Needed to create corpses, TODO: improve this
HolographicDisplays: Needed for pickup-able gun drops
Spigot/PaperSpigot: Obvious reasons
